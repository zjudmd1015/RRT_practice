## Introduction
A Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) is one of the most important tools used in robotic path planning. RRTs were first developed in 1998 by Steve LaValle at Iowa State. Dr. Lavalle is now a professor at UIUC, and was one of the inventors of the Oculus Rift. In the simplest of terms, an RRT is an algorithm that guarantees rapid exploration of some vector space. In fact given some domain D⊂ℝnD⊂Rn it is guaranteed that as the number of vertices in the RRT increases to ∞∞ the RRT converges on a uniform distribution over all of DD.
